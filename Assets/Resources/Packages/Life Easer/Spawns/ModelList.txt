Right-Click "ModelList.txt" file and press "Open on explorer" 
to copy this.

before the list, be aware that if you
want to make these models spawn when map starts
you need to add 
BirthSpawn="spawn object spawn name"  somewhere on it
(remove it if you don't.)

if you want to spawn it with a trigger or make it 
respawn on a specific spawn object, there's a Tutorial video on "tutorials" folder.

Warning: you still need to change the following properties:
"AI" (already explained) 
"Respawns" (idk what is this sincerely)
"AllowedSpawns"(spawn name of a spawn object)
"time" (delay before spawn happens)
