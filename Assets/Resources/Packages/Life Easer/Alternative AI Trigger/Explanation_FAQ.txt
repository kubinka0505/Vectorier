Hi! i'm "thelastcube"
important: if you use this check "enable custom properties" on "scriptmanager"
use this (Alternative AI Trigger,also known as "AAT") for any map or mod without the need of credit

FAQ:


- Does this work when exporting to mobile?
It should be.

- How to wall jump with this pack?
TriggerRight or TriggerLeft does the job.

- How do these work?
so, there's 4 prefabs, and they work as player's keyboard:
AI#_down    //  responsible for sliding

AI#_right   //  responsible for start running fast or resuming run

AI#_left    //  responsible for stop running fast or stopping run

AI#_up      //  responsible for jumping, tricks and vaults
# is  the number of the ai.

- How do i use it?
AI's are "values" on "Script manager" 
on "Custom Model properties"

Like " AI="1" " on a model means it's ingame "AI" variable is 1

- what is the difference from the prefab "Hunter" that comes with vectorier?
this prefabs changes the trigger code so it will only
trigger for that ai

you can interpret them as "Identifiers" for specific Triggers
for example:

you have a hunter and it's model "AI" value is 1
and you use the triggers from "AI 1 TRIGGER" folder
and you have a helper and it's model "AI" value is 2

It will only work for hunter because it's AI value is 1
any questions? dm me.
